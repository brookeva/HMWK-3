## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Load Data
```{r}
hh <- read.csv("1_Household_Public.csv")
per <- read.csv("2_Person_Public.csv")
veh <- read.csv("3_Vehicle_Public.csv")
trip <- read.csv("4_Trip_Public.csv")
```

## Question 1
```{r}
sort(unique(hh$HH_ID))[sample(11:20, 1)]
  #Random household = 101113
```

## Question 2
```{r}
subset(trip[c(2,3,15,18,28:35)], HH_ID == 101113)
```

## Question 3 

```{r}
table(per$WK_MODE[per$P_WEIGHT])
round(table(per$WK_MODE[per$P_WEIGHT])/length(per$WK_MODE[per$P_WEIGHT]),3)

### Amount of People 
sum(per$P_WEIGHT)

### Bikes
(column 5: 0.003 * 5627010?)
```
